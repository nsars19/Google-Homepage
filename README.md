This was a project completed for the purpose of demonstrating my understanding of basic HTML and CSS principles, further developing my skills with git/github (although I created the code with codepen, thus depriving myself of the many committed versions I would have otherwise have pushed. Oops.), and learning how to utilize Chrome dev tools.

Through completing this project I demonstrated that, through the power of strangely-written-word, I am capable of moving boxes around on a screen to such an extent that they resemble a web page that you and I virtually live on. Exciting. Really.

One key concept I came away with was that containers (<div>) are incredibly useful for chunking elements together for the sake of positioning and styling. Using <div> made the process much more time-efficient, and, more importantly I feel, less frustrating.

Another concept I came to have a broader understanding of was positioning. This was the biggest challenge for me. No box seemed inclined to move with the commands I gave it. Using the Position and Display properties helped with this task tremendously, as did the box-model properties.
